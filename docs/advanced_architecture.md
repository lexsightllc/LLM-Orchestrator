# Advanced Architecture Strategies

## 1. Distributed Event Log Sharding
- Partition events across shards (e.g., time or entity).
- Each shard maintains an append-only hash chain.
- Periodically anchor shard states into a global Merkle tree for cross-shard integrity.

## 2. Multi-Region CRDT Replication
- Use CRDTs so regions accept writes independently and converge.
- Propagate updates via low-latency gossip/pub-sub for <100ms visibility.

## 3. Dynamic SLA Re-Negotiation
- Maintain a control-plane channel for SLA updates.
- On SLA change, pause workflow and renegotiate terms without losing state.

## 4. Zero-Downtime Migration
- Apply the "strangler" pattern: dual-write events from the monolith to the new store.
- Gradually shift traffic to the new system while verifying audit continuity.

## 5. Cross-Lingual Token Optimization
- Track tokenizer quirks for each model.
- Transform or translate context to minimize token counts when switching models.

## 6. Predictive Model Pool Pre-Warming
- Forecast demand using time-series analysis.
- Pre-warm model instances to cover the 95th percentile load.

## 7. Federated Learning for Optimization Sharing
- Each orchestrator trains locally and shares model deltas.
- Use secure aggregation so raw data never leaves the instance.

## 8. Formal Workflow Verification
- Translate workflows into formal models (e.g., TLA+).
- Run model checkers to prove properties like safety and termination.

## 9. Quantum-Resistant Signatures
- Replace ECDSA with lattice-based schemes like Dilithium.
- Optionally use hybrid signatures to maintain current performance.

## 10. Hierarchical Budget Allocation
- Model budgets as a tree with real-time consumption tracking.
- Allow controlled rebalancing with exponential decay for unused funds.
