# Code of Conduct

We are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive community. All
participants are expected to:

- Show respect and empathy for others.
- Assume good intentions while addressing disagreements directly.
- Use inclusive language and avoid harassing behavior.
- Follow project maintainers' decisions during collaboration and review.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the maintainers at maintainers@example.com. Violators may be
warned, temporarily banned, or permanently removed from the community.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant v2.1.
